Imagine a world without the things that make our lives comfortable. No houses, no clothes, no food! Everything we use comes from the environment, but not everything is a resource. A resource is something that is useful, accessible, affordable, and culturally acceptable.

Transforming Nature's Gifts
We humans interact with nature through technology and institutions to create resources. We can classify these resources in various ways:

Origin: Biotic (living) or abiotic (non-living)
Exhaustibility: Renewable (can be replenished) or non-renewable (cannot be replenished)
Ownership: Individual, community, national, or international
Development: Potential, developed stock, or reserves
Resources and Development
Resources are vital for survival and quality of life. However, using them unwisely can lead to problems like depletion, inequality, and environmental damage. This is why resource planning is crucial for sustainable development, which means meeting present needs without compromising the future.

The 1992 Rio Earth Summit marked a turning point in global efforts to address environmental and development issues. Agenda 21, adopted at the summit, aims to achieve sustainable development by promoting global cooperation and addressing issues like poverty, disease, and environmental damage.

Resource Planning in India
India, with its diverse resource base, needs careful resource planning. Some regions are rich in certain resources but lack others. Resource planning involves identifying and assessing resources, developing infrastructure and technology, and integrating resource development with overall national development plans.

Conserving Resources
Resource conservation is vital to overcome environmental and socio-economic problems caused by over-consumption and inefficient use. India has a long history of resource conservation, with leaders like Gandhi advocating for mindful resource use.

Your Role
Identify the resources used in your daily life and their materials.
Survey your community's attitude towards waste recycling.
Learn about the resources being developed in your area with community participation.
Identify the resources found in your state and those that are important but scarce.
By understanding resources and their role in sustainable development, we can contribute to a better future for ourselves and generations to come.
